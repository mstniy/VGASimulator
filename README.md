# VGASimulator
A VGA simulator, written in C++

Interprets log files written by hardware simulators to create pleasent-to-look-at bitmap files.

Uses the same input file format as [Eric Eastwood's simulator](https://ericeastwood.com/lab/vga-simulator/), but the code is independently developed.

To use the program, simply call it with the path of the log file and total width and height of your frames (including porches) via the command line.
